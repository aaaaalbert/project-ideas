# project-ideas

This is a collection of, you guessed it!, project ideas for
newcomers/volunteers/students/whathaveyou. It tries to explain
a few "meta" issues upfront so as to express our expectations.


### Preliminary things to talk about

Projects are part technical/programming-oriented, part tools, part
structural learning.
* Technical things are what you implement, problems you solve
* Tools are, well, tools you need for this.
* Structural issues are recursion to reduce the (sub)problem complexity,
   time management, communication with supervisors and colleagues

None of this happens in a vacuum. Most often we have existing code,
people, workflows to look at, talk to, (re)use.

However, it's going to be *your* project.
[Searching for solutions on your own](http://catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/smart-questions.html#before)
is an important piece of the learning experience, and a skill
whose importance can't be overestimated in your further studies or
industry career.


Similarly, *you* are the best person to plan your time on the project.
We will quietly assume you can put in ~40 hours per week, and it probably
makes sense to not try to force those into a single day or two.
However, make plans that *you* think will work out, and schedule your
project accordingly. It's a good idea to have a Gantt chart or similar
on GitHub, and update it regularly as you make progress.

Re communication: Please be verbose!
All of our project teams have regular project meetings; students and
their supervisors should also have individual meetings for specific
questions and in-depth discussion.
Communication also includes code that you push to GitHub (and the commit
messages you write), any issues that you document or comment on, etc.
The [Secure Systems Lab guidelines](https://github.com/secure-systems-lab/code-style-guidelines/blob/contributor_guidelines/development_workflow.md)
has lots of helpful hints to get you started with using Git and GitHub.

And by the way, even if no other developer reads your code *now*, be aware
that you are communicating with your future self, future supervisors
and future recruiters that will want to take alook at a project of yours.


### With that out of the way, ...

More preliminaries!

* Learn Git and use GitHub. (You'll learn how to use them *right* as you go.)
* Read the [SecureSystemsLab collaboration guidelines](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/collaborate)
* Read any project-specific material that you find, and
* Write your own summaries of material you read! (Feel free to share too.)


### And *finally*, Project Ideas
* [Benchmark resource isolation in Docker and Seattle](docker.md)
