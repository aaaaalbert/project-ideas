# project-ideas

This is a collection of, you guessed it!, project ideas for
newcomers/volunteers/students/whathaveyou. It tries to explain
a few "meta" issues upfront so as to express our expectations.


### Preliminary things to talk about

Projects are part technical/programming-oriented, part tools, part
  structural learning
* Technical things are what you implement, problems you solve
* Tools are, well, tools you need for this.
* Structural issues are recursion to reduce the (sub)problem complexity,
   time management, communication with supervisors and colleagues

None of this happens in a vacuum. Most often we have existing code,
people, workflows to look at, talk to, (re)use.

However, it's going to be *your* project. Searching for soultions on
your own is an important piece of the learning experience, and a skill
whose importance can't be overestimated in your further studies or
industry career.

Similarly, *you* are the best person to plan your time on the project.
We will quietly assume you can put in ~40 hours per week, and it probably
makes sense to not try to force those into a single day or two.
However, make plans that *you* think will work out, and schedule your
project accordingly. It's a good idea to have a Gantt chart or similar
on GitHub, and update it regularly as you make progress.

Communication? Please be verbose!
We (project teams) have regular project meetings; we (student and
supervisor) should have individual meetings for specific questions
and in-depth discussion as well.
Communication also includes code that you push to GitHub (and the commit
messages you write), any issues that you document or comment on, etc.
Even if no other developers read your code, you are communicating with
your future self.


### With that out of the way, ...

More preliminaries!

* Learn Git and use GitHub. (You'll learn how to use them *right* as you go.)
* Read the [SecureSystemsLab guidelines](https://ssl.engineering.nyu.edu/collaborate)
* Read any project-specific material that you find, and
* Write your own summaries of material you read! (Feel free to share too.)


### And *finally*, Project Ideas

Sensibility:
* Sensor unit tests and showcases
* Sensor calibration using household items
* Tethering mode for local experimentation

Seattle:
 * Webify everything!
 * Python 3 port
 * Add sandbox types
 * A Better SeleXor
